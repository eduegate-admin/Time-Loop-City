# 🚀 Extreme Mode Roadmap: Time Loop City

This document outlines the aggressive development strategy for the "Game Studio" phase.

## 📅 Phase 1: Foundation Hardening (Current)
*   **A. Pipeline**: Automate asset generation (`ContentGenerator`).
*   **B. World**: Expand from "Primitives" to "Blockouts" with interiors.
*   **C. Camera**: Implement "Cinematic Transitions" and "Shoulder Surfing".
*   **D. Sound**: Layered dynamic audio (Music + Ambience + SFX).

## 📅 Phase 2: The Living World (Next Cycle)
*   **AI**: Implement `NPCBrain` (GOAP or Utility AI) for realistic schedules.
*   **Traffic**: Simple waypoint-based car system.
*   **Weather**: Volumetric Fog and Rain effects (Shader Graph).

## 📅 Phase 3: Narrative Depth
*   **Dialogue**: Branching conversations with choices.
*   **Evidence Board**: UI to connect clues visually.
*   **Multiple Endings**: Based on loop actions.

## 📅 Phase 4: Optimization & Release
*   **Performance**: Object Pooling for events/traffic.
*   **Builds**: Automated build scripts for Windows/WebGL.
*   **Marketing**: Trailer shot list and Steam page copy.

## 🔄 Continuous Cycle Checklist
Every feature must pass this filter:
1.  **Is it scalable?** (Can we have 100 of these?)
2.  **Is it testable?** (Can we automate the check?)
3.  **Is it fun?** (Does it add to the mystery?)
4.  **Is it polished?** (Sound, VFX, UI feedback?)

## 🛠️ Current Focus: Cycle 2 (Golden Path)
- [x] Mission System (Basic)
- [x] Dialogue System (Basic)
- [x] Clue Reading (Newspaper)
- [ ] **Next**: NPC Schedules & Traffic System.
